## Disclaimer
As this is a modification to the game, bugs may occur and performance may be slightly impacted.  Also, I'm not that great at coding, so if you can improve this, feel free to help out.

### While this mod and BepInEx are installed, please *DO NOT* report any bugs to YARC, *unless* you can reproduce them in the unmodded game!

## Installation in Stable Version
1.  For Windows users, download BepInEX_UnityMono_x64_6.0.0-pre.1.zip from here [here](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/tag/v6.0.0-pre.1) and extract the contents into the root folder of your current Stable Version installation of YARG.
  - You can download the latest stable version of YARG here [here](https://github.com/YARC-Official/YARG/releases) and then extract it to its own folder.
2. Download and extract the latest release of the mod from [Releases](https://github.com/  ).
3. Launch YARG.exe, and load into a song.
  - You should see the Simple Counter appear on the right side of the screen, somewhere below the score counter. If the counter doesn't appear, it means either the mod was not installed correctly, or an update may have broken it.
  - Updates that change YARG.Core could potentially break the mod, so keep this in mind when updating to a nightly build newer than the version listed above.
